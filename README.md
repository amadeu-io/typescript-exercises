# TypeScript Exercises üî¨

### Description üìö

Exercises designed to help me & other programmers get more familiar with TypeScript.

### Exercises ü•µ

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Function

- Define a function called `sumNumbers` that takes two parameters: `num1` and `num2`, both of type `number`.
  The function should return the sum of the two numbers.

- Implement the function body so that it correctly calculates the sum of the numbers.

- Declare two variables, `a` and `b`, and assign them any numeric values.

- Call the `sumNumbers` function with the variables `a` and `b` as arguments,
  and store the result in a variable called `result`.
- Print the value of `result` to the console.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Person Class

- Define a class called Person with the following properties:

  - Name of type string
  - Age of type number
  - Email of type string

- Implement a constructor for the Person class that accepts values for the name, age,
  and email properties and initializes them.

- Add a method to the Person class called introduce that prints a brief introduction of the person.
  The introduction should include their name, age, and email address.

- Create an instance of the Person class with your own information.

- Call the introduce method on the created instance to print your introduction.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Mixed Array Operations

- Create an array called `mixedArray` with the following values: "John", 25, true, "Jane", 30, false.

- Print the length of the `mixedArray` to the console.

- Access the second element of the `mixedArray` and store it in a variable called `secondElement`.

- Check if the fourth element of the `mixedArray` is a boolean. Print "It's a boolean" if it is,
  otherwise print "It's not a boolean".

- Create a new array called `numbersArray` and initialize it with the elements from `mixedArray`
  that are of type number.

- Create a new array called `stringsArray` and initialize it with the elements from `mixedArray`
  that are of type string.

- Print the `numbersArray` and `stringsArray` to the console.

### Prerequisites üõ†Ô∏è

- Install node.js as dev dependency

`npm install -D node`

- Install TypeScript compiler as dev dependency

`npm install -D typescript`

- Install ts-node as dev dependency (optional)

`npm install -D ts-node`

- With ts-node, you can quickly and directly execute TypeScript on Node.js without precompiling, by running the following command:

`npx ts-node <filename>.ts`

### Installation üì¶
