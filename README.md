# TypeScript Exercises 🔬

### Description 📚

Exercises designed to help me & other programmers get more familiar with TypeScript.

### Exercises 🥵

#### 1️⃣ TypeScript Function

- Define a function called `sumNumbers` that takes two parameters: `num1` and `num2`, both of type `number`.
   The function should return the sum of the two numbers.

- Implement the function body so that it correctly calculates the sum of the numbers.

- Declare two variables, `a` and `b`, and assign them any numeric values.

- Call the `sumNumbers` function with the variables `a` and `b` as arguments,
   and store the result in a variable called `result`.
  
- Print the value of `result` to the console.

### Prerequisites 🛠️

- Install node.js as dev dependency

`npm install -D node`

- Install TypeScript compiler as dev dependency

`npm install -D typescript`

- Install ts-node as dev dependency (optional)

`npm install -D ts-node`

- With ts-node, you can quickly and directly execute TypeScript on Node.js without precompiling, by running the following command:

`npx ts-node <filename>.ts`
